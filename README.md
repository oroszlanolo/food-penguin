# FoodPenguin

This project is a home recipe book and cooking assistant. You can store your own recipes, or recipes from the web. In addition to viewing the recipes, you can get random recipe suggestions, recipes that you have not used for a long time, recipes based on the ingredients in your fridge, or even plan a good menu for the entire week.
